It is good to get back to blogging finally, yay!!

Here be notes and observations,  
mistakes and lessons,   
tips and tricks,  
principles and practices, etc  

from an engineer who does not know how to brute-force, backtrack or even divide and conquer.

So take everything with a grain of salt. And drink a lot of water!
